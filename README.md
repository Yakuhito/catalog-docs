# CATalog FAQ

### What is CATalog?

CATalog is a fully decentralized, on-chain database containing CAT asset details such as symbol, name, and display images. CAT issuers register their CATs and receive an NFT which can be used to change the corresponding entry's details at any time. Validators - usually marketplaces or sites that display such data - create attestations for every CAT that abides by their listing rules (e.g., 'The CAT is not trying to impersonate another CAT'). Because everything is on-chain, all websites, wallets, and dApps can see this data and act on it.

### How is a CAT's owner determined?

The owner of a CAT is defined as the first entity to register that CAT's TAIL program on CATalog. For this reason, **must** use a CAT issuance tool that supports CATalog in order to avoid someone else claiming their CAT's entry.

### How should I refer to CATalog?

Please always spell CATalog like this sentence does - the first three letters should be in uppercase, while the rest of the word is in lowercase. The only exception to this rule is Rust code, where you may spell CATalog as `Catalog`  to meet naming conventions.
